# stock-analysis
## Project Overview
### Purpose of the analysis
- The purpose of the analysis was to take stock data from 2 different years and figure out how the different stocks have performed in that year.  We've been tasked with refactoring the code that we worked through in the module and make it more efficient.  Once refactored the code should run more efficiently and reduce the run times. 

## Results
### Analysis
- After looking at the run times of the refactored code it is clear that the new code significantly reduces the run times and makes things more efficient. Below is an example of the 2018 analysis you can see that the code ran in about .17 seconds.  Previously that same analysis took almost a full second to run.  While in this vacuum the .8 seconds saved by refactoring the code may not seem like a lot, but if this analysis were to grow into either more tickers or additional years that time begins to add up and we can feel confident that we are running good code.

 ## Summary
 ### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code
 - Refactoring code is a fundamental process in development.  Just because the code works doesn't mean that it is the best way to do it, or that it solves it in the most efficient way possible.  It's always a good idea to revisit code that you believe could be more efficient or code that you maybe inherited from someone else.  Different developers have different ways of solving the same problem and reworking some code could leave to significant improvements.  Cons could potentially be that it takes time to do this refactoring and that can take you away from working on other things.  You could also work on this refactoring and it could lead to minimal improvements or very little ROI.
 
 ### Applying those pros and cons to this analysis 
 - In this instance there were definitely more pros than cons to refactoring the code for this analysis. The refactoring lead to a significant reduction in run time, and the code is now simpler to read.  I definitely think that the investment in time in refactoring of this code was worth it.
